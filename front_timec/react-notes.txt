Redux lets you to manage state in declarative way.
Your react components should be function of data:
v = f(d)
where (v - view, d - data)
Redux lets you to extend this further as:
d = a(s)
where (q - action, s - store).

There is only one dispatcher manageing actions from many components.


Main concepts:
store, reducers, actions, action-types, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps.
